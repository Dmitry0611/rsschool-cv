## Personal
I am junior frontend devoleper. I appre-ciate this profession for its innovative-ness and constant development. I constantly monitor my growth and try to keep up with the times.  I worked in the choricas industry for 10 years, which has given me an extraordinary amount of skills in dealing with cowor-kers and guests. Also, I am a big wine connoisseur and have been through several stages of training. In my spare time I like to follow soccer and snooker.
